# Internship Task 2 – Web Build Automation

## Overview
This project is developed as part of the **Web Development Internship Program**.  
Internship Task 2 focuses on understanding **modern frontend build workflows**
using **templating engines** and **task automation tools** to generate
production-ready web output.

The project demonstrates how structured source files are compiled into a
clean and maintainable build using **Gulp** and **Nunjucks**.

---

## Objective
The primary objective of this task is to:
- Implement a structured project layout
- Use reusable templates for HTML generation
- Automate the build process
- Produce a production-ready `dist` folder

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Markup structure  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **Nunjucks** – Template engine for reusable layouts  
- **Gulp** – Task automation and build management  
- **Node.js** – Runtime environment  

---

## Project Structure
src → templates/assets → Gulp build → dist (production output)

## Workflow Explanation
1. Source files are maintained inside the `src` directory  
2. Nunjucks templates are used to create reusable layouts  
3. Gulp automates the compilation and asset handling process  
4. Final production files are generated inside the `dist` folder

## How to Run the Project
1. Install Node.js  
2. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
3. Run the build process:
     npx gulp
4. Open dist/index.html in a browser

## Output

 -> Clean single-page website

 -> Professional layout and styling

 -> Automated build output

 -> Production-ready folder structure

## Learning Outcomes

Through this task, I gained hands-on experience in:

-> Modern frontend project structuring

-> Template-based HTML generation

 - Build automation using Gulp

 -> Managing source and production files efficiently
